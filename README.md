Simple application to display Patient Access exported XML test results in a more friendly, shorter form, than the PDF exports provided by the service.

Input is c:\temp\RecordData.Xml and needs to be an Test Results Export from Patient Access website.

Result is a rich text list of test results grouped by test type, sorted by date and colourised to indicate if any tests are outside normal range.

This is just a proof of concept that's been useful to me when taking test results from my GP area to my consultant area, which since they're in different counties, believe it or not, means the consultant can't access my test results directly!
